Effective heart disease prediction using hybrid machine learning techniques
In this project, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning 
techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The prediction model is 
introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. 
We produce an enhanced performance level with an accuracy level of 93% through the prediction model for heart disease 
with the hybrid random forest with a linear model (HRFLM).
